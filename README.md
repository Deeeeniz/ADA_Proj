# Mahammad Sheykhov — CV & Portfolio

**Project: ADA_Proj**

**Project Summary**:
- **Purpose**: Single-page Jekyll-based CV/portfolio compiled from `ADA_Proj1j.md` into `index.html` and served via GitHub Pages.
- **Work done**: Interactive 6-section portfolio created, color palette restyled to warm earth tones, CSS/JS extracted from the markdown into separate files for maintainability.

**Files**:
- **`ADA_Proj1j.md`**: Main content (markdown + HTML structure). This is the Jekyll source for the homepage.
- **`_layouts/default.html`**: Jekyll layout wrapper (now references external CSS/JS)
- **`ADA_CSS.css`**: All site styles (extracted from the markdown)
- **`ADA_ProjJS.js`**: All client-side scripts (extracted from the markdown)
- **`_site/index.html`**: Generated site output (do not edit directly — generated by Jekyll)

**How to build locally**:
- Install Jekyll and Ruby (if not already installed).
- From the project folder (`c:\Users\User\Documents\ADA_Proj`) run in PowerShell:

```powershell
# clean previous build
jekyll clean
# build the site into _site/
jekyll build
# (optional) serve locally with auto-regeneration
jekyll serve --watch
```

**Deployment & GitHub Pages**:
- The site is deployed using GitHub Pages from the `main` branch (pushes to `main` trigger new deployments).
- Older deployments are kept as records; only the latest deployment is active (green check).

Git commands (examples):
```powershell
# check changes
git status
# stage
git add .
# commit with message
git commit -m "Describe changes"
# push to origin/main
git push origin main
```

**Removing old generated HTML**:
- If you have an unwanted HTML file in repo root (e.g. `ADA_Proj1j.html`) remove it and rebuild:

```powershell
Remove-Item ADA_Proj1j.html -Force
jekyll clean
jekyll build
# then commit+push
git add -A
git commit -m "Remove old generated HTML"
git push origin main
```

**Color palette** (current):
- **Burnt Orange**: `#D35400` (primary headings, accents)
- **Mustard/Gold**: `#F39C12` (badges, highlights)
- **Olive Green**: `#556B2F` (secondary accents)
- **Warm Beige**: `#EED6B7` (light background)

To change the palette, edit the CSS variables in `ADA_CSS.css` (top of file, `:root { ... }`).

**Where behavior lives**:
- Navigation, Intersection Observer, smooth scroll are implemented in `ADA_ProjJS.js`.
- When editing JS, keep `defer` in the `<script>` tag (in `_layouts/default.html`).

**Notes about builds & deployment history**:
- Multiple deployments in GitHub are normal — each successful push creates a new deployment. The green check marks the most recent (successful) deployment.
- To inspect logs for a deployment, open the repository on GitHub → `Actions` or `Pages` (depending on how your pages are configured) and click the deployment entry.

**Changelog (high level)**:
- Extracted CSS and JS from `ADA_Proj1j.md` into `ADA_CSS.css` and `ADA_ProjJS.js`.
- Updated `_layouts/default.html` to reference external assets.
- Rebuilt site and verified `_site/index.html` links to external assets.

**Next steps / Suggestions**:
- Add a `.gitignore` entry for `_site/` (to avoid committing generated files): add `_site/` to `.gitignore`.
- Consider adding a `README` section with deployment URL: `https://Deeeeniz.github.io/ADA_Proj/`.
- If you want older deployments removed from the GitHub UI, review the repository's Pages settings and Actions history — note: GitHub retains deployment records for audit.

**Contact / Help**:
- If you want, I can:
  - Add a `.gitignore` entry for `_site/` and commit it.
  - Commit the `README.md` for you (if you want me to run the git commands).
  - Make any palette or layout tweaks and rebuild.
